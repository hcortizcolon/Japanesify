 * Because iteration over Maps happens by insertion order, this avoids

 * first, leading to the longer word's substitution never triggering.
 *
 * For example, the 'kya' substitution would never get triggered
 * if the 'ya' substitution happens first because the input term 'kya'
 * would become 'kゃ', and the search for 'kya' would not find any matches.
